# Savekey

A modern and secure Password Manager for Desktop and Mobile.

## About

Nowadays, everyone has some kind of an Internet Account. And we all know the dilemma with remembering our Passwords. So most People just have one Password that's easy to remember. In the worst case scenario, their Password is something like 'password', 'Hamburger' or '123456'. And these Passwords aren't really good. Modern Computers can crack them in under a second. \
So having a safe and complicated Password, in the base case, different passwords for different Accounts, can really prevent your accounts from beeing hacked. 

That's what this App is for. You can create and store safe Passwords, without anyone having even the slightest chance of knowning them. \
You just have to remember your one Masterpassword.

## Security

This App matches the top of the List Security-standards. You don't have to worry about anything.


## Design

Because this App was built with Dart, the Flutter Framework is used. I decided to go with the Material Design, Google's Mobile Design Language.
This App is mainly built with this Design System, but I implemented a few extras, to make it beautiful and matching on any Operation System.


## Internationalizing

Through the [String_Translate Package](https://pub.dev/packages/string_translate) I built myself, this App supports different Languages. \
At the Moment these Languages are supported:
* English
* German
* French
* Spanish
* Portuguese
