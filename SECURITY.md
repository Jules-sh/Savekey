# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the newest Version are supported with Updates and new Features.
If you want to use an older Version, or need to, and still want Feature and Security Updates,
contact the Administrator, with the Version you want to use.

## Update Policy

I'm doing by best to provide you with regulary Updates. Once I release a new Version, all the new Updates will depend on that Version. Meaning, you can skip a Version, but you can't get a Bugfix for your Version without updating to the next Version.
For example:
If Version 2.5.6 would contain a Bug and the next Version I release is 2.6.0 or maybe even 3.0.0, than you have to upgrade to that Version. There won't be a 2.5.7 with just the Bugfix.

Thanks for you Understanding.
